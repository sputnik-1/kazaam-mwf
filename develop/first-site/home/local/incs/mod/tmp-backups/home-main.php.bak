<span class="article_heading">New Battery Tech boosts the ability of 
rechargeable lithium-ion batteries</span>
<span class="article_date">Jan&nbsp;18,&nbsp;2008</span>

<p>Standard lithium-ion batteries use graphite anodes that are capable
of holding only a limited amount of charged lithium particles. The
graphite anodes' limited capacity is chiefly responsible for the
relatively brief charge life of lithium-ion batteries. Replacing the
graphite anodes with silicon nanowires would increase the battery's
charge storage capacity, Stanford researchers found.

<span class="article_date">November&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2007</span>

<p>The Taipei Times is reporting that around 1,800 new 300GB and 500GB
external hard drives manufactured by Maxtor shipped with malware on
them.  What makes this story even more interesting is that Taiwanese
authorities suspected that Chinese authorities were involved. The bureau
said that hard discs with such a large capacity are usually used by
government agencies to store databases and other information.

<span class="article_heading">Laser innovation speeds up hard disks</span>
<span class="article_date">July&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2007</span>

<p>Researchers in the Netherlands say they have come up with a way of
using lasers to speed up magnetic hard drives by a factor of 100.</p>

<p>A paper published by Daniel Stanciu of the Institute for Molecules
and Materials at Radboud University Nijmegen describes a method of using
ultrarapid pulses of polarized light to heat up areas on a hard disk
and, crucially, using the same light to change the polarity of those
areas.</p>

<p>The polarity of the disk storage medium is reversed by reversing the
polarity of the laser pulses, according to a recent report. This
optically induced, ultrafast magnetization reversal, was previously
believed impossible, and it is the combined result of femtosecond laser
heating of the magnetic system to just below the Curie point, and
circularly polarized light simultaneously acting as a magnetic field.
Similar effects have previously been used in magneto-optical storage
devices, but those used a magnetic field applied by conventional means,
not by the laser.

<span class="article_heading">Windows Activation trips up virtual machine clones, even on same system</span>
<span class="article_date">June&nbsp;7,&nbsp;2007</span>

<p>This blog entry is simply to clear things up regarding virtual
machine software (like VMware), the way it can make clones of existing
virtual machines, and what if any impact such cloning has when it
involves software that requires some form of online activation like
Microsoft&#39;s operating system and Office software do. The reason
I&#39;m writing this is that, going back to my last blog entry regarding
VMware Workstation 6 (the latest release of VMware Workstation), the
TalkBack&#39;s disputed my assertion that moving a virtual machine that
has Windows as its operating system from one system could be a jarring
enough of a hardware change that it would, "invariably awaken the
licensing gods at Microsoft."
