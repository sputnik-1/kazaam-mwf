PROGRAM LISTINGS
----------------

For program listings, use Lyx-code.

For the program listing title heading (program name) use:

Family: Roman

Series: Bold


For the code listing itself, use:

Lyx Text style box:

Family: Typewriter

Series: Bold

Program Comments:

Use proper punctuation style. ie start the first word of each sentence
with a capital letter. Use commas and full stops for punctuation.
Keep comment lines short for PDF output.

How to Add a New Program Listing:

Make sure the lines in the source code are not to long.

Open a new window to import the source code file.

Use Insert->File->Plain Text to import the file into the new window.

Save it as the program's 'filename.lyx' .

Select the whole document with Ctrl-A.

Change to the LyX-Code environment.

Set the style as above.

Add 00's to the start of each line.

Format the document to match the original source code layout.

Once the formatting is complete and OK, add line numbering in place of
zeroes.

When the document is finished, import it into the main manual.
