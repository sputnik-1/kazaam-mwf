All include files under /develop/shared-host are used by *all*
development websites on this server.

Any modifications to files in /develop/shared-host will be applied to
*all* development websites on this server.

NOTE: live websites use another directory for these files:
  /live/shared-host

This enables updates to these files to be tested first, before being
deployed to the live website directory.
