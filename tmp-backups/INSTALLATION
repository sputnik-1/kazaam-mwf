How to install Kazaam
---------------------

Pull the code from GitHub into a test directory that is in your Apache's
DocumentRoot setting.

If your Apache's DocumentRoot is set to:

DocumentRoot /my-webserver/docs

Then you will need to put kazaam-mwf somewhere like:

/my-webserver/docs/kazaam-mwf 

With your text editor go to 

/kazaam-mwf/develop/kazaam-sitetpl/shared/incs/

and open the domain.conf.php file for editing.

Find the following code at lines 27-30:

// Full path to the virtual host's base directory relative to Apache's
// DocumentRoot setting. This needs to be set to "" for virtual hosts
// in the live code branch.
$WEBSITE_ROOT = "/KAR/MyGithubProjects/live/PHP/kazaam-mwf/develop/kazaam-sitetpl";

Now change the $WEBSITE_ROOT setting to match where you have installed kazaam-mwf

So for the above DocumentRoot example this would be:

$WEBSITE_ROOT = "/kazaam-mwf/develop/kazaam-sitetpl";

Now save domain.conf.php and using your web browser go to:

http://localhost/kazaam-mwf/develop/kazaam-sitetpl/home/anyuser/home.php

You should now see the homepage for the kazaam website template. This is
the basic website that gets copied when you want to create another
website using the phing project build script create-new-website.xml.

You will also need to change this for the intermediate code branch as well.

$WEBSITE_ROOT = "/kazaam-mwf/intermediate/kazaam-sitetpl";
