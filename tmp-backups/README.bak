Kazaam-mwf

Kazaam is a PHP Modular Website Framework. It's written in PHP5, XHTML,
CSS and Javascript. You can use Kazaam to quickly create a working
website to modify and extend as required. It's ideal for novice and
professional use.

I originally developed this for my own use circa 2006, but I have now
made kazaam-mwf available under the BSD license in 2013.

Please see /framework-docs/user-guide/KazaamUserGuide.pdf for full
details of what kazaam is, and how to use it to build websites.

See REQUIREMENTS needed to use kazaam.
See INSTALLATION instructions for installing kazaam.
