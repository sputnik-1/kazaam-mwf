REQUIREMENTS
------------

Kazaam needs a working PHP development environment, and the PHING PHP
build tool.

I use Linux and the LAMP stack for developing kazaam-mwf.

Whatever your platform you will need to set up a working PHP
development environment and install PHING to use kazaam-mwf.

Here are some pointers to setting up your PHP development machine:

LINUX
-----

Just use your Linux package manager to install:

* Apache

* MySQL

* PHP - you will need the command line version installed, as well as the
  Apache PHP module.

* Phing - this is a project build tool based on ANT.

WINDOWS
-------

I use a package of pre-compiled tools, such as:

WAMP http://www.wampserver.com/en/

Make sure you have all the required VC++ runtime libraries installed,
otherwise WAMP will not work.

To install PHING on Windows the easiest way is to follow this guide:
http://www.phing.info/trac/wiki/Users/Installation

"The preferred method to install Phing is through PEAR and the Phing PEAR
channel. You can install Phing by adding the pear.phing.info channel to
your PEAR environment and then installing Phing using the phing channel
alias and phing package name." 

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php

PHING is dependant on PEAR (for the easiest install), and PEAR depends
on PHP.

The installation order on Windows then is:

PHP first
Then PEAR
Then PHING


MAC OSX
-------

I've not installed a working PHP developer's environment on this OS yet.

There is http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html

But I have not tested this personally myself.
